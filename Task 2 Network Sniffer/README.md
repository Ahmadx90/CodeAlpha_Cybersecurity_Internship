# 🧠 Task 2: Network Sniffer

This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship**.  
It captures live network traffic, analyzes packets, and saves them into `.pcap` format.

## 🚀 Features
- Captures live network packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Displays protocol, source/destination IP, ports, and payload
- Saves captured packets into `.pcap` files
- Displays clean table-style console output

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmadx90/CodeAlpha_Cybersecurity_Internship.git
cd "Task 2 Network Sniffer"
pip install -r requirements.txt
